## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

It's the EJS and Express made demo you know and love! CRUD at it's finest. Complete with like and dislike functionality.

<!-- ## Optimizations
*(optional)*

You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews! -->
